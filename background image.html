"    "For a second I was almost jealous of the clouds." ...
    "The sun always shines above the clouds." ...
    "Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain        usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky." ...
    "Behind every cloud is another cloud." ...
    "Clouds suit my mood just fine."
